020200 to 0203f0 working values  - pulled from another location
These are level, possibly character number, mech hp/max hp mostly for viewing purposes.
These also contain the stage # and the credits if you do a basic menu.  Strategic map.
Also does cost of spirits.  
99% certain this is the section that gets written to for ANY numbers

020400 to 0204f0 is something to do with menus likely

above is basically working ram


0202e70 bytes 3 to 7 are cursor position, but written into and not active







S-CPU bus
0000a2 pulls turn counter?
0001d0 to 0001ef Unsure what these are, think they're pointers of some variety.
000200 to 0003ff calls and stores various stats about mech and pilot NOT edittable
000400 to 0004ff saves current switch positions?
000500 to 0006ff I believe has to do with a menu state?  map constantly being redrawn in various 		aspects?  This seems to be CONSTANTLY written to.
000800 relates to the graphics of the mech on pilot screen, including what palette to call
000900 grid positions for the pointer - 900 is actual realtime movement 902 is grid position 		after movement 901 and 903 get used if beyond 16  01-0f is subgrid positions used 		for 900 so that it looks like the pointer is moving and not static



000c80 is player map sprites - c80 for some reason refers to substats and graphics for first 		unit, c81 is shading / color / faction - I believe these are static to the 				scenario likely in the sprite templates?
000cb0 refers to enemy ones.
000e00 stores menu type kind of information
000d00 starts player unit horizontal positions, first number is grid, second is sub grid GRAPHIC 		ONLY
000d30 starts enemy unit horizontal positions, first number is grid, second is sub grid GRAPHIC 		ONLY
000d80 starts player unit vertical positions, first number is grid, second is sub grid GRAPHIC 				ONLY
000db0 starts enemy unit vertical positions, first number is grid, second is sub grid GRAPHIC 				ONLY
000e00 menu and map states, including menu position, camera position, grid limits, and which 				menus to call it feels like.  e00 is what menu to pull e01 refers to which 				template to switch to? 00e3A is menu position regardless of menu.  00ea7 is 				aparently very important for scene transitions.  E20 references color of new 				text?  E01 ?
000f00 battle and timing things?.  f00 is horizontal movement, f01 is vertical movement.  They're 		also used as a timer in nonbattle  f02-5 are dangerous and unsure what they refer 		to without knowing all the things that can be put in here safely.
000f10 points to background textures  000f12 is texture effects ( transparancy ) / graphics?
000f20 pointers ?  For text calls I believe.  Also contains timers for different texture effects.
000f30 seems to be specifically for timing a robot's death.
001000 stats like turn count and money
001008-1010 is current credit count
0010ed starts pilot level in hanger, not map, this value is used when the pilot levels on map and 		is the more important one.
00116D starts player pilot exp, used everywhere and important for level randomization for the 		player when its time.
0011ee starts player mechs IN HANGER ONLY


001300 states what a particular unit can attack?
001406 starts player "AI" will almost always be empty
001436 starts enemy AI
001486 starts player's "war with" faction?  Causes wonk - You can choose to target your forces 		with that said unit, said unit WILL NOT be able to be attacked.
0014b6 starts enemy "war with" faction?  causes them to hit themselves.

001506 starts player mech another graphic position *** May need another location updated!!
001536 starts enemy mech another graphic position *** May need another location updated!!
001586 starts player pilot and it's level that is seen on map, but does not affect stats, does 				affect exp earned
0015b6 starts currently active enemy pilot and their level which doesn't matter - stats do not 		get adjusted


001606 starts player mech piloted and its Will in map   
001636 starts enemy mech piloted and its Will in map    
001686 starts player spirit current/max
0016b6 starts enemy spirit current/max ** never uses
001706 starts player move values and how the mech moves in general
001736 starts enemy mech movement values
001786 starts player energy cur / max   
0017b6 starts enemy energy cur / max    
001806 starts player current health   NOTE: FIRST NUMBER IS SMALLER THAN LATTER NUMBER.  MULTIPLY LATTER # BY 256 ADD TO FIRST VALUE
001836 starts enemy current health    NOTE: FIRST NUMBER IS SMALLER THAN LATTER NUMBER.  MULTIPLY LATTER # BY 256 ADD TO FIRST VALUE
001886 starts player max health   NOTE: FIRST NUMBER IS SMALLER THAN LATTER NUMBER.  MULTIPLY LATTER # BY 16 ADD TO FIRST VALUE
0018b6 starts enemy max health   NOTE: FIRST NUMBER IS SMALLER THAN LATTER NUMBER.  MULTIPLY LATTER # BY 16 ADD TO FIRST VALUE
001906 starts player intuition
001936 starts enemy intuition
001986 starts player aim and control
0019b6 starts enemy aim and control
001a06 starts player reaction and power ( power is x10 from value )
001a36 starts enemy reaction and power
001a86 starts player armor and limit ( ceiling for all stats )
001ab6 starts enemy armor and limit
001b00 - 001cff unsure, but they are used on the scenario map and may have something to do in regards to menus.

ROM
b432/3 seems to refer to a background layer index?

0682xx seems to be mostly relating to Scenarios and MS positioning/type/etc.

068260 is X grid value of first enemy pilot in scenario 1
068261 is y grid value of first enemy pilot in scenario 1
068262 when changed from 38 to 39 made Char become Lalah - Any time Char loaded on map, Londo Bell was referred to.  Amuro can't talk to the new pilot who changed from char in Scenario 1.  Will need to update another time.
068264 is mech
068265 is when this unit/pilot becomes active for AI purposes
068267 x# is color of mech   #x is team of mech
66 unsure of what bytes mean yet.

This continues down to

0682d8 in a similar format

0682e0 has 4 bytes of FF for some reason, then it starts player?  * Changing these does WEIRD things to player locations and data.

0682e4 pilot
0682e5 pilot level
0682e6 mech/ship
068267 x# is color of mech   #x is team of mech

it then repeats per 4


068310 unsure why these are FFs, probably a way to tell the code loading it to break so it can load he next important data, see below
068312/3 is player MS 1 x/y position


068316 if changed makes Amuro disapear?  Or adjust to whoever the pilot is corresponding to in this byte?  
This section is odd.  First two bytes will always be WB/Bright ( or whoever should be it's pilot )
Then it's split into sets of 3 bytes, presumably regarding which pilot / mech goes in that spot as a pointer.  IF PILOT DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO HANGER, NOONE GOES IN THAT SLOT PERIOD.


07ba8d unsure why this is 00

07ba8e is where enemy reinforcements are called from for scenario 1




c0b432 breaks everyone's status screen.  Likely has to do with color sor something along those lines in this area.  Changing b434 to 89 made hp bar full red



I learned the hard way that the above values, while they work in the debugger / memory editor of emulators... the hex values in windows are different somehow.

030260 starts enemy scenario 1 info.
